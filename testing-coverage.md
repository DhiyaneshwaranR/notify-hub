|---------------------|----------|---------|
| Email Service       | 80%      | âœ…      |
| SMS Service         | 85%      | âœ…      |
| Template Service    | 75%      | âœ…      |
| Queue Service       | 70%      | âœ…      |
| Worker System       | 75%      | âœ…      |
| Notification Service| 65%      | ðŸš§      |
| Retry Service       | 60%      | ðŸš§      |
| Health Service      | 50%      | ðŸš§      |

### Priority Testing Needs
1. Notification Service
    - Batch operations
    - Scheduled notifications
    - Status updates
2. Retry Service
    - Exponential backoff
    - Failure categorization
    - Recovery strategies
3. Health Service
    - System health checks
    - Performance monitoring
    - Alert thresholds

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Increase coverage of Health Service to 70%
2. Complete Retry Service test suite
3. Add integration tests for worker system
4. Implement E2E tests for critical paths

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. Achieve 80% overall coverage
2. Complete all core service test suites
3. Add performance test suite
4. Implement stress testing scenarios

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
1. Achieve 85%+ overall coverage
2. Complete E2E test suite
3. Add chaos testing scenarios
4. Implement continuous performance monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Focus on individual service methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Test queue operations
- Test multiple services together

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete notification flows
- Test multiple channels
- Test error scenarios
- Test performance

## Test Infrastructure

### Current Setup
- Jest as test runner
- MongoDB Memory Server for database tests
- Redis Mock for queue tests
- SendGrid sandbox mode for email tests

### Needed Improvements
1. Coverage reporting setup
2. Integration test infrastructure
3. E2E test framework
4. CI/CD pipeline integration

## Running Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Environment Setup
Required environment variables for testing:
```env
NODE_ENV=test
SENDGRID_API_KEY=test_key
```
## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. One assertion per test when possible
4. Use proper setup and teardown
5. Mock external dependencies

### Test Organization
1. Group related tests in describes
2. Use before/after hooks appropriately
3. Keep test files organized with consistent naming
4. Separate unit and integration tests

### Code Coverage
1. Focus on meaningful coverage
2. Don't just test for coverage numbers
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. Include both happy and unhappy paths
