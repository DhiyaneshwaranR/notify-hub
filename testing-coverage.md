### Overall Statistics
- Current Coverage: ~30%
- Files Tested: 3/15 core files
- Lines Covered: TBD (needs coverage reporting setup)
- Branches Covered: TBD (needs coverage reporting setup)

### Service Coverage

#### Email Service (80% covered)

- Email sending with sandbox mode
- Template rendering
- Attachment handling
- Multiple recipients
- Error handling and retries
- Webhook event processing

- Priority handling
- Dead letter queue
- Item cleanup
- Requeue mechanism

ðŸš« Missing Coverage:
- Rate limiting logic
- Circuit breaker scenarios
- Health check operations
- Complex error conditions

#### Notification Service (60% covered)
âœ… Tested Features:
- Notification creation
- Notification retrieval
- Multiple channel handling
- Basic error handling

ðŸš« Missing Coverage:
- Scheduled notifications
- Batch operations
- Status updates
- Advanced error scenarios

### Untested Components

#### High Priority
1. Template Service (0% coverage)
2. Base Worker (0% coverage)
3. Queue Health Service (0% coverage)
4. Controllers (0% coverage)

#### Medium Priority
1. Middleware (0% coverage)
2. Models (0% coverage)
3. Routes (0% coverage)
4. Validators (0% coverage)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Focus on individual service methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Test queue operations
- Test multiple services together

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete notification flows
- Test multiple channels
- Test error scenarios
- Test performance

## Test Infrastructure

### Current Setup
- Jest as test runner
- MongoDB Memory Server for database tests
- Redis Mock for queue tests
- SendGrid sandbox mode for email tests

### Needed Improvements
1. Coverage reporting setup
2. Integration test infrastructure
3. E2E test framework
4. CI/CD pipeline integration

## Running Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Environment Setup
Required environment variables for testing:
```env
NODE_ENV=test
SENDGRID_API_KEY=test_key
```

## Coverage Goals

### Short Term (Next 2 weeks)
- Achieve 50% overall coverage
- Complete high priority service tests
- Set up coverage reporting

### Medium Term (Next month)
- Achieve 70% overall coverage
- Add integration tests
- Complete API endpoint tests

### Long Term (Next quarter)
- Achieve 80%+ overall coverage
- Add E2E tests
- Add performance tests

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. One assertion per test when possible
4. Use proper setup and teardown
5. Mock external dependencies

### Test Organization
1. Group related tests in describes
2. Use before/after hooks appropriately
3. Keep test files organized with consistent naming
4. Separate unit and integration tests

### Code Coverage
1. Focus on meaningful coverage
2. Don't just test for coverage numbers
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. Include both happy and unhappy paths

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Set up Jest coverage reporting
2. Complete Queue Service tests
3. Add Template Service tests
4. Start integration test setup

### Short-term Goals
1. Reach 50% coverage
2. Add CI/CD pipeline
3. Set up coverage thresholds
4. Complete high-priority service tests

### Future Enhancements
1. Add performance testing
2. Add load testing
3. Add security testing
4. Implement continuous testing in CI/CD
